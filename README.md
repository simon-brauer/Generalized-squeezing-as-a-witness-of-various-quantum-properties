The attached codes are used to calculate the data published in the article: Generalized squeezing as a witness of various quantum properties. 
This article can also be found on arxiv: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.09210.

Looking_for_border_state.ipynb is the main code in which all data are calculated. 
Both the optimization itself, which is in the main text of the article "Generalized squeezing as a witness of various quantum properties", 
and the calculation of things contained in the supplement. Collective_library.py is then a library of necessary functions.

Keywords: quantum witness, metric, resource theory
